# {{ school_name }}

ACE school repository — shared skills, conventions, and session prompts for your team.

## For Developers

Subscribe a project to this school:

```sh
ace setup {school_specifier}
```

This clones the school, symlinks skills into your project, and configures your AI coding
session. Run `ace` to start.

## Structure

```
school.toml       # School configuration
skills/           # Skill directories (each has a SKILL.md)
  ace-school/     # Built-in school management skill
CLAUDE.md         # AI session instructions for this repo
```

`school.toml` defines: env vars, MCP server endpoints, project catalog, and skill imports.
See `CLAUDE.md` for section details.

## Managing Skills

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Import a skill | `ace import <owner/repo>` |
| Re-fetch imports | `ace school pull` |
| Review local edits | `ace diff` |

Skills are the primary content of this repo. Each skill is a directory under `skills/` with
a `SKILL.md` that the AI backend reads during coding sessions.
